## The following are the main points of the Monty Hall Problem:

1. As there are three doors, a random permutation of the numbers 1, 2, and 3 would be generated, with each number representing a door. 
2. This permutation contains the first two numbers that correspond to the location of goats behind the door, and the third number corresponds to a car behind the door.
3. Only the door behind which there is a goat is to be revealed after the user has chosen a door number according to the puzzle. 
4. By selecting the door behind which the car is parked, the user can then reveal either of the other two doors. 
5.If the user selects a door behind which there is a goat, only one of the two remaining doors can be revealed (since the previously selected door cannot be revealed).
