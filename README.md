# Monty-Hall-Problem-Python

Monty hall problem simulation in python

## What is Monty Hall Problem ?

I love watching movies and I learn a lot from the movies and books.
The first time I came across the Monty hall problem was when I was watching movie titled 21.

Assume there are three doors, and behind one of them is a car, while behind the other two are goats. If you choose the door with the car behind it, you win the car. Now, say you choose the door 1. The host then opens either Door 2 or Door 3, behind which is a goat. (He knows what is behind each door, and never open the door with the car behind it.) Host now gives you the choice: Do you want to stick with Door 1, or switch to the other door. What Should you do? Would you change you decision or not?

Now the battle lies Emotions vs Math, Mathematically switching would give you a 2/3 probability of winning rather than sticking to the same door as the probablity of winning a car among those two door would concetrate into one.

## How are we going to Simulate ?\

In this source code I have simulated this problem using random module to simute the process, and with enough trials the probablity winning when you switch convert to 0.66 which is equivalent to 2/3.

## what will our app do?

Once you run the application, a very simple gui will pop up with an entry box, write in it no of sample to be simulated and then press enter and then program will evaluate total wins for case of same choice or switching.
